## WELCOME TO DDlink

DDLink is a web application for freelance designers and developers to post and or search for work projects of interest.

Borrowing from the dating app format of swipe and like, DDLink allows for designers and developers to connect with each other based on projects of interest and skills. It makes the search for work interactive, social and without information overload.
